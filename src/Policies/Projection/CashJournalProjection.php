/**
 * Cash journal — the separation of cash from non-cash transactions, and the cash-count check.
 *
 * GoBD Rz. 57 ff. asks for cash and non-cash transactions to be kept apart. In double-entry
 * that separation is already structural rather than a flag: a transaction *is* a cash
 * transaction exactly when it touches an account of subtype `cash`. So nothing has to be
 * marked and no field has to be added — what was missing is the view that presents the
 * separation, which is the form an auditor asks for (the cash account's sheet *is* the
 * Kassenbuch).
 *
 * The second half is the part that finds real defects: **a cash balance can never be
 * negative.** You cannot hold less than no cash — that is physics, not jurisdiction, which
 * is why it belongs in the substrate and not in a pack. A cash account that goes below zero
 * at any point means the books do not describe what was in the drawer, and it is one of the
 * first things a tax auditor looks for. The running balance is therefore checked at every
 * movement, not only at the end: a day that dips negative and recovers is exactly the case
 * a closing balance hides.
 *
 * Reports, never blocks. Whether a negative balance stops a workflow is the embedding
 * application's decision; the library supplies the finding.
