/**
 * Postings still in status `entered` at a reference date (F-CORE-027).
 *
 * GoBD asks for finalization "at the latest with the VAT return" (Rz. 47 ff.) — a deadline
 * nothing in the data enforces, because it is a *German* rule and the substrate is
 * jurisdiction-free. What the substrate can do is make the deadline observable: the journal
 * already carries `entryDate` and `recordedAt`, so how long a posting has been sitting open
 * is a fold over the journal, not new state.
 *
 * The age is measured from `entryDate` (the bookkeeping date, zoneless) against `asOf`, not
 * from `recordedAt` — a posting recorded late for an old date is exactly the case the
 * deadline is about, and measuring from the recording moment would hide it.
 *
 * The projection reports; it never blocks. Which age is too old, and what happens then, is
 * the embedding application's workflow — the library supplies the number.
 *
 * Each row carries `actor` (F-CORE-037): who recorded the posting. This is the projection a
 * separation-of-duties check reads — "nobody may finalize a batch containing their own postings" —
 * and without the author it was the one question it could not ask here, so an application read the
 * whole audit trail per finalization and rebuilt the mapping itself. See `EntryAuthors`.
